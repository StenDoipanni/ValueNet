The MFTriggers knowledge graph is the graph operationalizing MFT ontological module, namely providing lexical grounding to Moral Foundations Theory value-violation dyads.
It was generated according to the image shown below: starting from lexical units (LU) used to described values and violations, these were used to extract FrameNet frames, WordNet synsets and VerbNet verbs. These were in turn used to perform queries to the Framester resource to retrieve semantic entities triggering some specific Value.

Yellow boxes are  classes of entities, while blue ovals are queries, as shown in figure some entities were reused to perform further queries and extract more triggers, in a semi-automatic process (human in the loop is required to clean and polish data extraction in order to avoid undesired noise).
